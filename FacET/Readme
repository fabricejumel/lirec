FacET (Facial Expression Tracker) is a library of image processing 
procedures for detecting and parameterising face components (eg. eyes, 
eyebrows, lips, forehead wrinkles). 
Such face features are useful for classification of human emotions 
based on facial expression.

The current version of FacET was developed by Marek Wnuk and is
based on the application created for Marcin Namysl's Master thesis 
(supervised by Marek Wnuk, Wroclaw University of Technology, 
Institute of Computer Engineering, Control and Robotics): 
"Wykorzystanie systemu wizyjnego do rozpoznawania emocji czlowieka"
("Vision system in human emotions recognition").

    FacET is a library for detecting and parameterising face components.

The library code was written and tested in linux environment.
Some minor changes (marked GC) were provided by Ginevra Castellano 
for maintaining compatibility with windows.

The demo code (timer and main) contains several conditional branches 
(#ifdef WIN32) for windows compatibilty, proposed by Ginevra Castellano, 
but was not tested in this environment yet.

Compilation (in linux environment) requires OpenCV 1.0:
"make" - to make lib and demo;
"make docs" - to produce doxygen documentation in doc/html and doc/latex.
