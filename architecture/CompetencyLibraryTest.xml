<!-- Competency library for the test scenario. Following all competencies
have to be listed. You need to specify 
a) the class name, 
b) optional parameters that should be passed to the competency during 
construction (assumed parameter type is String, parameters are seperated by comma).
c) if you include the attribute runInBackground and set it to "true" the competency
will be started and run in background as soon as it is initialised, it will then however
not be available to include in competency execution plans, since it will be already
running in the background. -->
