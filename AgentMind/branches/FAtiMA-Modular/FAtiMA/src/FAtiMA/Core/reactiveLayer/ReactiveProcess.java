 * History: 
 * João Dias: 21/12/2004 - File created
 * João Dias: 23/05/2006 - Added comments to each public method's header
 * João Dias: 10/07/2006 - the class is now serializable 
 * João Dias: 15/07/2006 - Removed the EmotionalState from the Class fields since the 
 * 						   EmotionalState is now a singleton that can be used anywhere 
 * 					       without previous references.
 * João Dias: 17/07/2006 - The following methods were moved from class Agent to this class
 * 							  - AddEmotionalReaction
 * 							  - GetEmotionalReactions
 * 							  - GetActionTendencies
 * João Dias: 21/07/2006 - The class constructor now only receives the agent's name
 * João Dias: 05/09/2006 - Changed the way in which Attribution Emotions are generated. From
 * 						   now on, is no longer necessary to specify attribution reactions for
 * 						   a character. They are automatically generated when a "look-at" action
 * 						   is perceived, and the like appraisal variable is retrieved from semantic
 * 						   memory (the KnowledgeBase)
 * 						 - Changed the way in which FortuneOfOthers Emotions are determined, now 
 * 						   the interpersonal relationShip (like/dislike) between characters affects the desirability
 * 						   of the event and thus the final emotions being generated.
 * João Dias: 06/09/2006 - Another change in the way that FortuneOfOthers Emotions are determined,
 * 						   they now are generated for the Actor that performs the actions, and the
 * 						   object or character that is the target of the action. We take into account
 * 						   the like relations between every character to determine the event's desirability.
 * João Dias: 18/09/2006 - Small change in the generation of FortuneOfOther emotions. Now they consider the 
 * 						   the new other variable. If this variable is defined the FortuneOfOther emotion
 * 						   created will be directed to the character specified in the variable. If the variable
 * 						   is not defined (null) the emotion is proccessed as before.
 * João Dias: 20/09/2006 - Removed the method RemoveSelectedAction. The method
 * 						   GetSelectedMethod now additionally has the functionality 
 * 						   of the RemoveSelectedAction method
 * João Dias: 03/02/2007 - the Reset command now removes the selectAction if any
 * João Dias: 04/08/2007 - The intensity of attribution emotions (Love/Hate) were halved
