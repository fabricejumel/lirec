Chinese literature dating from as early as 650 BC tells the legend of Lo Shu 
or "scroll of the river Lo". In ancient China there was a huge flood. The great 
king Yu tried to channel the water out to sea where then emerged from the water 
a turtle with a curious figure/pattern on its shell; circular dots of numbers 
which were arranged in a three by three grid pattern such that the sum of the 
numbers in each row, column and diagonal was the same: 15, which is also the 
number of days in each of the 24 cycles of the Chinese solar year.

This pattern, in a certain way, was used by the people in controlling the river.
