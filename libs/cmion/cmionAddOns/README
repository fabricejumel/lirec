Instructions for building yarp for Java
Authors: dave@fo.am from instructions by Michael Kriegel

This was documented from linux, but it should be similar on windows.

You need ace, yarp and cmake installed.

* Go to yarp/examples/swig and run cmake . 

On linux I had to run ccmake . and enter the JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH by hand, it should be something like:
PATH /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.17/include/
PATH2 /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.17/include/linux

* Run make to build the swig binding this should give you libjyarp.so
* Run the following commands to build the java yarp api

$ cd generated_src/
$ javac *.java
$ echo Main-Class: yarpJNI > manetfest.txt
$ mv generated_src yarp
$ jar cvfm jyarp-linux.jar manefest.txt yarp
