This document describes installation of SAMGAR (version 2.x) on Linux system (tested on Ubuntu x64).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Start from creating a common directory for installation purpose

mkdir SRC_DIR
cd SRC_DIR

1. Download the latest version of SAMGAR from 

svn co https://svn.lirec.org/libs/SAMGAR/trunk SAMGAR

On yarp-2.3.0 aplication works but it was sometimes unstable. On yarp-2.3.1 aplication seams to work more stable.

2. Download and install the latest version of yarp from download page
http://eris.liralab.it/yarp/specs/dox/download.html
or do this from command line i.e.

wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/yarp0/yarp-2.3.1.tar.gz

Then extract the archive

tar xf yarp-2.3.1.tar.gz

3. Make sure that you have installed all essential software and libraries for compilation of yarp like ACE.

sudo aptitude install libace-dev cmake cmake-curses-gui

You can omit cmake-curses-gui, but I recommend to install this packet.
Having all essential software and libraries installed you can install Qt that is required by SAMGAR V2

sudo aptitude install libqt4-dev

4. Copy SAMGAR GUI files to proper yarp subdirestory

cp SAMGAR/GUI/*.cpp yarp-2.3.1/src/yarpserver/src/
cp SAMGAR/GUI/*.h yarp-2.3.1/src/yarpserver/src/
cp SAMGAR/GUI/*.qrc yarp-2.3.1/src/yarpserver/src/
mkdir yarp-2.3.1/src/yarpserver/src/images
cp SAMGAR/GUI/images/*.* yarp-2.3.1/src/yarpserver/src/images

5. Modify CMakeList.txt file responsible for compiling yarpserver

gedit yarp-2.3.1/src/yarpserver/CMakeLists.txt

After line 

if (CREATE_YARPSERVER3)

add following lines

FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4 COMPONENTS QtCore QtGui QtXml REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE})

then beforre the line

add_executable(yarpserver3 ...)

add line

QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(SERVER3GUI_RC_SRCS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/server3Gui.qrc)
QT_WRAP_CPP(yarpserver3 SERVER3GUI_MOC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/server3Gui.h)

add at the end of add_executable(yarpserver3 ...) file list following files

${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/samheader.h ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/server3Gui.h ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/server3Gui.cpp ${SERVER3GUI_MOC} ${SERVER3GUI_RC_SRCS}

Finally change the line 

target_link_libraries(yarpserver3 YARP_init)

to 

target_link_libraries(yarpserver3 YARP_init ${QT_LIBRARIES})

Then go to YARP directory

cd yarp-2.3.1

and configure cmake 

ccmake .

I suggest building inside the source because otherwise one might have some problems with further usage of SWIG wrapper.

Select to ON position variables CREATE_GUIS and CREATE_YARPSERVER3
Then press two times [c] and [g] to generate makefile. Build yarp

make

and install it

sudo make install

6. To build example SAMGAR application one have to prepare cmake to use YARP 

sudo cp FindYARP.cmake /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/

If your version of cmake is not 2.8 please fix the above liene so it will fit to your system.
Than go to module directory  

cd ../SAMGAR/Modules

to prevent making mess in code this time I suggest to build outside the source, so we have to create a new directory

mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ../

If you want to compile Examples please select EXAMPLES_ENABLE to ON.
If you want to compile other projects you have to select {ProjectName}_ENABLE to ON.
Type [c] two times and then [g]. After creating makefile compile the example module

make

After succesfull compilation if you have selected EXAMPLES_ENABLE to ON then exacutable example binary files can be found in

SAMGAR/Modules/build/Examples 

You should find there following executable file:

SamExamples  

if you have OpenCV installed then you will also find there files:

VideoGet  VideoSend

7. To make example working first start 

yarpserver3

and then the example module

SAMGAR/Modules/Examples/build/SamExamples

Aster starting SamExample in yarpserver3 GUI appropriate elements should appear. You can connect modules ports by clicking 
left mouse button on the desired ports.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDINT NEW MODULE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To add your own new module you should go to

cd SAMGAR_DIR/Modules

create new directory

mkdir MyNewModule
cd MyNewModule

create there files in the similar way that they are created in SAMGAR/Modules/Examples direcotry. Finally you should modify

SAMGAR_DIR/Modules/CMakeLists.txt

by adding similar lines to those that are there for Examples module. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Above mentioned installation process does not include the icons and other graphical elements

2. Starting yarpserver3 application in the directory containing SAMGAR graphics (GUI/Bin directory) caused Segmentation Fault
after starting SAMGAR/Module/Examples/build/SamExample with following error description

QObject::connect: Cannot queue arguments of type 'QTextCursor'
(Make sure 'QTextCursor' is registered using qRegisterMetaType().)
QPixmap: It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread
QPixmap: It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread

QPixmap: It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread
QPixmap: It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread
QPixmap: It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread
Segmentation fault

3. Installation process should be more simple. Patches and script should be applied.
