This document describes installation of SAMGAR V2 on Linux system (tested on Ubuntu x64).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Start from creating a common directory for installation porpoise

mkdir SRC_DIR
cd SRC_DIR

1. Download the latest version of SAMGAR V2 from 

svn co https://svn.lirec.org/libs/SAMGAR%20V2/ SAMGAR_V2

2. Download and install the latest version of yarp from download page
http://eris.liralab.it/yarp/specs/dox/download.html
or do this from command line i.e.

wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/yarp0/yarp-2.3.1.tar.gz

Then extract the archive

tar xf yarp-2.3.1.tar.gz

3. Make sure that you have installed all essential software and libraries for compilation of yarp like ACE.

sudo aptitude install libace-dev cmake cmake-curses-gui

You can omit cmake-curses-gui, but I recommend to install this packet.
Having all essential software and libraries installed you can install Qt that is required by SAMGAR V2

sudo aptitude install libqt4-dev

4. Copy SAMGAR V2 GUI files to proper yarp subdirestory

cp SAMGAR_V2/GUI/*.cpp yarp-2.3.1/src/yarpserver/src/
cp SAMGAR_V2/GUI/*.h yarp-2.3.1/src/yarpserver/src/

5. Modify CMakeList.txt file responsible for compiling yarpserver

gedit yarp-2.3.1/src/yarpserver/src/CMakeList.txt

After line 

if (CREATE_YARPSERVER3)

add following lines

FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4 REQUIRED)
SET(QT_USE_QTXML 1)
INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE})

then beforre the line

add_executable(yarpserver3 ...)

add line

qt_wrap_cpp(yarpserver3 SERVER3GUI_MOC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/server3Gui.h)

add at the end of add_executable(yarpserver3 ...) file list following files

${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/samheader.h ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/server3Gui.h ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/server3Gui.cpp ${SERVER3GUI_MOC}

Then go to YARP directory

cd yarp-2.3.1

and configure cmake 

ccmake .

I suggest building inside the source because otherwise one might have some problems with further usage of SWIG wrapper.

Select to ON position variables CREATE_GUIS and CREATE_YARPSERVER3
Then press two times [c] and [g] to generate makefile. Build yarp

make

and install it

sudo make install

6. To build example SAMGAR application go to 

cd ../SAMGAR_V2/Module

to prevent making mess in code this time I suggest to build outside the source, so we have to create a new directory

mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ../

Type [c] two times and then [g]. After creating makefile compile the example module

make

7. To make example working first start 

yarpserver3

and then the example module

SAMGAR_V2/Module/build/SamExample

Aster starting SamExample in yarpserver3 GUI appropriate elements should appear. You can connect modules ports by clicking 
left mouse button on the desired ports.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Above mentioned installation process does not include the icons and other graphical elements

2. Starting yarpserver3 application in the directory containing SAMGAR V2 graphics (GUI/Bin directory) caused Segmentation Fault
after starting SAMGAR_V2/Module/build/SamExample with following error description

QObject::connect: Cannot queue arguments of type 'QTextCursor'
(Make sure 'QTextCursor' is registered using qRegisterMetaType().)
QPixmap: It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread

QPixmap: It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread

Segmentation fault

3. Installation process should be more simple. Patches and script should be applied.
