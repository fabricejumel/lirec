Simple Face Identification
--------------------------

Uses OpenCV's face finder to record and detect identity. Sends bottles over 
yarp on port /faceident containing the ID and confidence value.

Use the number keys to train the system against different individuals. The idea 
is that one by one, individuals show their faces, after which the system will 
recognise who is who in the camera's view. The program will avoid recording 
faces which are too similar to existing recorded ones. Press 'd' to switch to 
switch off the training and just detect against existing faces. The boxes 
around the faces display the id and the confidence value of the match.

Requires: OpenCV
Written and tested on Linux, but it should work in Windows too.
At the moment you'll probably have to run it with:

simple-faceident --cascade=/path/to/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

In order to find OpenCV's data, on my machine it's in:
/usr/local/share/opencv/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

Todo:
* Command line parameters
* YARP interface
* Try normalised cross correlation instead of image differencing
