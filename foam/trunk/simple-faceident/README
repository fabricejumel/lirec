Simple Face Identification
--------------------------

Just uses OpenCV's face finder and records faces it's seen for 100 frames 
(tweakable at the top of main.cpp). After that it returns the id of the 
nearest match in it's database of faces. The max number of faces it stores is 
also set at the top of main.cpp.
 
Requires: OpenCV
Written and tested on Linux, but it should work in Windows too.
At the moment you'll probably have to run it with:

simple-faceident --cascade=/path/to/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

In order to find OpenCV's data, on my machine it's in:
/usr/local/share/opencv/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

Todo:
* Command line parameters
* Calibration mode on a keypress
* Play with better calibration modes
* YARP interface
* Use 'least recently detected' to remove faces from the database
* Try normalised cross correlation instead of image differencing
