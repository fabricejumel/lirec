Simple Face Identification
--------------------------

A simple approach to face identification, built on top of OpenCV and given a 
YARP network interface.

The program has two modes of operation. The first is calibration, where each 
user must show their face to the camera separately - press the number keys to 
assign each user with a different ID. You can see which face is mapped to 
which ID at the bottom of the window.

The second mode of operation is face detection, where each visible detected 
face is given an ID based on it's closest match (within a given error 
threshold) with the faces recorded during calibration. The boxes drawn around 
the faces display the id and the confidence value of the match. When in this 
mode the program sends the following YARP messages:

Port         Bottle contents                Meaning
/faceident 	"user appeared" ID confidence   A user has entered the view of the camera
/faceident 	"user disappeared" ID           The user has left the camera view

Key                 Meaning
0-9 number keys     Calibrate a given id against a face in the scene
d                   Start detect mode, which will send YARP messages
c                   Clear all faces in the database

Requires: OpenCV, YARP

Written and tested on Linux, but it should work in Windows too. At the moment 
you'll probably have to run it with:

simple-faceident -cascade=/path/to/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

In order to find OpenCV's data, on my machine it's in: 
/usr/local/share/opencv/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

Todo:
* Try normalised cross correlation instead of image differencing
