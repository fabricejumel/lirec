In order to build SamgarKey for linux, I needed to change the CMakeLists.txt 
as follows:

Firstly change the implicit casts from yarp strings to std::strings in 
MainComponent.cpp (this may be a compiler version issue, not sure at present) - 
eg:

- string tempstring10 = mytempconnect.firstport;
+ string tempstring10 = (const char *)(mytempconnect.firstport);

Change the location of the juce includes and libs:

include_directories 	(/path/to/juce/bin)
include_directories 	(/path/to/juce)
link_directories 	(/path/to/juce/bin)

Add the include location of freetype and lib location of samgar lib:

include_directories 	(/usr/include/freetype2)
link_directories 	(../../SAMGAR\ LIB/Trunk/)

Add the following libs to the target link:

target_link_libraries	(SamgarKey SamgarLIB X11 asound freetype GL Xinerama)
